BootIgnighter
=============
BootIgnighter is a project that provides devs with a quick-start to using Twitter's Bootstrap CSS Framework with the PHP MVC Framework, CodeIgnighter.
Along with the Bootstrap files jQuery-1.11.1 and Shiv-HTML5 fix for Internet Explorer 8 or older is also included.

# FILE STRUCTURE
 Bootstrap files are located in the Bootstrap directory in the project root, Bootstrap files are purposely kept seperate to allow SASS or LESS to be used easier.

* jQuery and HTML5 Fix are located in the /js directory in the project root.

* We recommend JavaScript files are put in the /js directory.

* We recommend StyleSheet files are put in the /css directory.

* We recommend Images are put in the /img directory.

* We recommend Fonts are put in the /fonts directory.


# DEFAULT SETUP
* All required files are included in the header.php file located in CodeIgnighter's default Views directory, /application/views     /templates/header.php

* A DIV tag with the "container" class is opened in the header.php file and closed in the footer.php file.

* The BODY and HTML tags are also both closed in the footer.php file.

* An empty style.css file is also linked within the header.php file, this can be optionally used to add more style to your views, this file can be found at /css/style.css 

*We recommend using the minified files when your project is put into production for optimal speed and bandwith use.*
